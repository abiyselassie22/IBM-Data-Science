# Tools for Data Science

## Summary

This course teaches popular tools in Data Science and how to use them. It involves the Data scientist's tool kit, which includes Data Science libraries & packages, datasets, machine learning models, kernels, various open-source, commercial, Big data & cloud-based tools. One will get an opportunity to work with Jupyter notebooks, Jupyter lab, R studio IDE, Git, GitHub and Watson Studio. One will also understand what each tool is used for, and what programming languages can be executed, along with their features & limitations. The course gives plenty of hands-on experience in order to develop skills for working with these Data science tools. We will be able to test each tool, hosted in the cloud on Skills Network Labs, and follow instructions to run simple code in Python, R or Scala. In the Final Project, we will create a Jupyter Notebook, through which we will demonstrate our proficiency preparing a notebook, writing a Markdown, and sharing our work with our peers.
