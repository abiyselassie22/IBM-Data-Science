# Data Science Methodology

## Summary

This course introduces two notable Data Science methodologies: IBM Foundational Methodology & the six-stage CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining). It teaches how to apply these methodologies to effectively solve Data science problems. This methodology is used by Data Scientists to tackle data science problems beginning with Business understanding. The steps have included forming a concrete business or research problem, collecting, preparing & analyzing data, building a model & understanding the feedback after model deployment. We will develop our Data Science Methodology skills using a Real-World inspired scenario through progressive labs hosted within Jupyter Notebooks & using Python. In the Final Project, I chose the topic on emails, and I played the role of the Client and the Data scientist to apply the Data Science methodology and solved the problem I faced regarding the vast number of spam & non-spam messages I received daily in my email inbox. I solved the problem by first defining the problem in Business understanding, and then completed the Analytic Approach, Data Requirements, Data Collection, Data Understanding and Preparation, Modeling and Evaluation stages.
