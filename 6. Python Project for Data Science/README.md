# Python Project for Data Science

## Summary

This course demonstrates the foundational Python skills for working with data. It involves completing a project in which one will assume the role of Data Scientist. It provides one with a Real-World dataset & a Real-World scenario to identify patterns & trends. It involves working on a hands-on project developing a dashboard using python. One will perform specific data science tasks such as extracting data, webscraping, visualizing data & creating a dashboard. The project will showcase one's proficiency with python & using libraries such as pandas & Beautiful soup within a Jupyter Notebook.
