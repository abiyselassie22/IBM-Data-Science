# Data Visualization with Python

## Summary
This course teaches how to create meaningful, effective, and aesthetically pleasing data visuals & plots in Python using Matplotlib & other libraries such as Seaborn, Folium, Plotly & dash. It teaches the many ways to effetively visualize both small-scale & large-scale data. It teaches one to work with many data visualization tools & techniques. It teaches how to create various types of basic & advanced graphs & charts like:. One will learn how to create interactive dashboards that allow even those without data science experience to better understand data, and make more effective & informed decisions. One will also complete numerous hands-on labs and a Final Project to practice & apply the many aspects & techniques of Data visualization using Jupyter Notebooks & cloud-based IDE. In the Final assignment, I took a role of a data analyst with a task to monitor and report US domestic airline flights performance & then analyze the performance of the reporting airline to improve flight reliability thereby improving customer reliability.
