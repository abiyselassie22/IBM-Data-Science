# Machine Learning with Python

## Summary

This course gives a general overview of Machine Learning topics such as Supervised vs Unsupervised learning, Linear & Non-linear regression, and the usage of each algorithm. It then dives into classification techniques using different classification algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), decision trees and Logistic Regression, and apply them on various datasets to solve real world problems. It also teaches how to use k-means clustering for customer segmentation. One will complete numerous hands-on learning labs by working with Python Libraries like SciPy & Scikit-learn. In the Final Project, one will demonstrate the learned skills by building classifiers, evaluating, and comparing several machine learning models using different algorithms (Linear Regression, KNN,  Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM) to predict whether there will be rain the following day.
